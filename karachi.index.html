      Karachi is the capital of the Pakistani province of Sindh. Situated on the
      Arabian Sea, Karachi serves as a transport hub, and is home to Pakistan's
      two largest seaports, the Port of Karachi and Port Bin Qasim, as well as
      the busiest airport in Pakistan. Though the Karachi region has been
      inhabited for millennia, the city was founded as the fortified village of
      Kolachi in 1729. <br />
      <br />
      Karachi is one of the world's fastest growing cities, and has communities
      representing almost every ethnic group in Pakistan. <br />
      <br />
      Karachi is built on a coastal plains with scattered rocky outcroppings,
      hills and coastal marshlands. Coastal mangrove forests grow in the
      brackish waters around the Karachi Harbour, and farther southeast towards
      the expansive Indus River Delta. West of Karachi city is the Cape Monze,
      locally known as Ras Muari, which is an area characterised by sea cliffs,
      rocky sandstone promontories and undeveloped beaches. <br />
      <br />
      Within the city of Karachi are two small ranges: the Khasa Hills and Mulri
      Hills, which lie in the northwest and act as a barrier between North
      Nazimabad Town and Orangi Town. Karachi's hills are barren and are part of
      the larger Kirthar Range, and have a maximum elevation of 528 metres
      (1,732 feet).

            Not only are winters a great time to visit Karachi because of its
            mild cold weather, but also because it’s the time when you can spot
            turtles at Turtle Beach. This beach is home to green sea turtles
            that come out to lay their eggs in the sands. It’s also a good
