    <h1>How to Make Time Work For You — The Time Mastery Framework</h1>
    <p>
      Do you feel as though you don’t have enough time? And you’re not really in
      control of time, is it? We have no control over how quickly time passes;
      especially with so many demands on our time and energy for everyday
      matters, we can easily feel overwhelmed and swept. As a result, we may
      feel helpless or as if time is working against us. While you can’t control
      time itself, you can control how you spend it. It is much preferable to
      spend one hour of high quality time on things that are important to you
      than ten hours doing things that are not time-worthy. When it comes to
      time, quality is always more important than quantity. In this article, you
      will learn how to improve your quality of time and take back control of
      your day with Lifehack’s unique framework on time management.

    <h2>The Time Mastery Framework.</h2>
    <p>
      The Time Mastery Framework is a framework I’ve gradually developed since
      starting Lifehack. <br />
      The Time Mastery Framework is a 5-step Framework: <br />
      1:Track – It is keeping track of how you are currently spending your time
      in order to identify areas where you could improve. <br />
      2:Design – It entails making a plan for how you want to spend your time
      and setting goals for yourself. <br />
      3:Optimize – This refers to discovering ways to use your time more
      efficiently and productively. <br />
      4:Do – It is all about putting your strategy into action and making the
      most of your time. <br />
      5:Review – It entails checking in on your progress on a regular basis and
      making any necessary changes to your plan.
